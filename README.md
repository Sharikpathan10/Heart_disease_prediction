# Predicting-Heart-Disease
Introduction
World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.

👉 This dataset contains information about contains diagnoses of heart disease patients. Machine learning model is needed in order to determine whether a person has heart disease or not

👉 The models used in this notebook:

Logistic Regression

👉The libraries used in this notebook:

numpy

pandas

sklearn 




👉 The following is the structure of the dataset.
